- uplink.md and blink.md are newly created for the purpose of knowledge transfer. 
- my-notes are notes I made for myself while working here. some of them may be outdated. some of them may be useful. they are included in case anyone wants to see what i was thinking or what i tried while working on stuff. 
- mpeg-4-specifications are from the MPEG-4 spec. They are very expensive and are needed to implement call recording.
