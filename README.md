  Uplink

<h4 align="center">Privacy First, Modular, P2P messaging client built atop Warp.</h4>

<br/>

Uplink is written in pure Rust with a UI in [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs) (which is also written in Rust). It was developed to be a new foundation for the basic implementation of Warp features in a universal application.

The goal should be to build a hyper-customizable application that can run anywhere and support extensions.

## Quickstart

To get running fast ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.


**Standard Run:**
```
cargo run --bin ui
```

**Rapid Release Testing:**
This version will run closely to release but without recompiling crates every time.
```
cargo run --bin ui --profile=rapid
```
